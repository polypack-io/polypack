# Polypack

Polypack is a **self-hosted package registry** that supports multiple package managers. It is a simple, free, and open-source solution for teams to efficiently manage dependencies and release their own packages to internal teams or external clients.

## Why Choose Polypack?

### 🤝 **Multi-Package Manager Support**
